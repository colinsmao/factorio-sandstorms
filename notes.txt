Warning, take caution when removing this mod while a weather event is active. Reduced solar efficiency is applied to the global surface, and will not automatically be returned to normal. If solar efficiency is stuck at <100% when a weather event is not active, it can be reset by running the command
    /c game.player.surface.solar_power_multiplier = 1
Though this will not play nice with SE planets, which have different default solar multipliers. 

To make bots automatically go clean/repair them, the dustiness of a panel is applied by increasing their maximum health (but not current health). When the extra health is repaired, the panel changes back to a regular solar panel. Due to the jankiness of this implementation, mining a dusty panel will always return a full health regular panel. Otherwise you end up losing health, since transfer_entity_health_to_products seems to transfer health_ratio rather than absolute health points.

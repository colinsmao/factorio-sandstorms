Warning, take caution when removing this mod while a weather event is active. Reduced solar efficiency is applied to the global surface, and will not automatically be returned to normal. If solar efficiency is stuck at <100% when a weather event is not active, it can be reset by running the command
    /c game.player.surface.solar_power_multiplier = 1
Though this will not play nice with SE planets, which have different default solar multipliers. 

To make bots automatically go repair them, the dustiness of a panel is applied by lowering their health. So if a dusty panel ever gets damaged for real, they will have lower than usual health. Don't be using solar panels for biter defense.
